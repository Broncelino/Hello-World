# overview
My name is Bryson Williams I have always loved computers and have been programming for a few years now. This repository
will stand as the front page of my portfolio. I've already made other programs in various languages and have them 
posted to this github. As of now 9/17/22 I am aiming to become a Database admin or something else in that field.

Code: this code is a simple print statement in the pythong language.
